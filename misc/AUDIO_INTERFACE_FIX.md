# ðŸŽ¤ Audio Interface Integration Fix

## Overview

The audio interface in the NYP FYP Chatbot application was calling a non-existent `ask_question` function. This document explains the fix and how the audio interface now correctly integrates with the backend chatbot system.

## Problem Statement

**Issue**: The audio interface was calling `ask_question` function which doesn't exist in the codebase, causing errors when users tried to process audio input.

**Root Cause**: The audio interface was using an outdated function call that was never implemented or was removed during refactoring.

## Solution Implemented

### 1. **Fixed Import Statement**

```python
# Before (incorrect)
from backend import transcribe_audio, ask_question

# After (correct)
from backend import transcribe_audio
from backend.chat import get_chatbot_response
```

### 2. **Updated Function Calls**

The audio interface now correctly calls `get_chatbot_response` instead of the non-existent `ask_question`:

```python
# Before (incorrect)
response_result = loop.run_until_complete(
    ask_question(transcription, chat_id, username)
)

# After (correct)
response_result = loop.run_until_complete(
    get_chatbot_response(transcription, [], username, chat_id)
)
```

### 3. **Updated Response Processing**

The response format from `get_chatbot_response` is different from what `ask_question` was expected to return:

```python
# Before (expected dict format)
if isinstance(response_result, dict) and response_result.get("code") == "200":
    response = response_result.get("response", "No response received")
    if isinstance(response, dict) and "answer" in response:
        response = response["answer"]

# After (correct tuple format)
# get_chatbot_response returns (empty_message, updated_history, chat_id, all_chats_data, debug_info)
if len(response_result) >= 2:
    updated_history = response_result[1]
    if updated_history and len(updated_history) > 0:
        # Get the last bot response from the updated history
        response = updated_history[-1][1] if len(updated_history[-1]) > 1 else "No response received"
```

## Function Signature Comparison

### `get_chatbot_response` (Correct Function)

```python
async def get_chatbot_response(
    message: str,
    history: List[List[str]],
    username: str,
    chat_id: str
) -> Tuple[str, List[List[str]], str, Dict[str, Any], str]:
```

**Returns**: A tuple of 5 elements:

1. `empty_message` (str) - Always empty string
2. `updated_history` (List[List[str]]) - Updated chat history with new exchange
3. `chat_id` (str) - The chat ID (may be updated if new chat created)
4. `all_chats_data` (Dict[str, Any]) - All user's chat data
5. `debug_info` (str) - Debug information

### `ask_question` (Non-existent Function)

This function was never implemented in the codebase.

## Integration Points

### 1. **Audio Processing Flow**

1. User records/uploads audio file
2. Audio is transcribed to text using `transcribe_audio()`
3. Transcribed text is sent to chatbot using `get_chatbot_response()`
4. Response is extracted from the updated history
5. Both transcription and response are displayed to user

### 2. **Edited Transcription Flow**

1. User edits the transcribed text
2. Edited text is sent to chatbot using `get_chatbot_response()`
3. Response is extracted and displayed
4. Both original transcription and edited version are tracked in history

### 3. **Chat History Integration**

- Audio sessions create unique chat IDs (e.g., `audio_session_abc123`)
- Each audio interaction is stored in the user's chat history
- Audio sessions are searchable through the search interface
- Chat history is persisted and can be accessed across sessions

## Testing

A comprehensive test suite has been created to verify the audio interface integration:

- **File**: `tests/backend/test_audio_integration.py`
- **Tests**:
  - Direct function call testing
  - Module import verification
  - Response format validation
  - Error handling verification

## Benefits of the Fix

1. **Functional Audio Interface**: Users can now successfully process audio input
2. **Consistent Integration**: Audio interface uses the same backend as the chat interface
3. **Proper Error Handling**: Better error messages and handling of edge cases
4. **History Persistence**: Audio interactions are properly stored in chat history
5. **Search Integration**: Audio transcriptions are searchable through the search interface

## Usage Example

```python
# Audio interface now correctly processes audio:
# 1. User uploads audio file
# 2. Audio is transcribed: "Hello, how are you?"
# 3. Transcription is sent to chatbot
# 4. Chatbot responds: "Hello! I'm doing well, thank you for asking..."
# 5. Both transcription and response are displayed
# 6. Interaction is stored in chat history
```

## Future Enhancements

1. **Real-time Audio Processing**: Stream audio for live transcription
2. **Voice Response**: Add text-to-speech for audio responses
3. **Audio Quality Optimization**: Improve transcription accuracy
4. **Multi-language Support**: Support for multiple languages in audio input

## Conclusion

The audio interface fix ensures that users can successfully use audio input for chatbot interactions. The interface now properly integrates with the backend chat system, maintains chat history, and provides a seamless user experience for audio-based interactions.
