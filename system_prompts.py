    Returns the system prompt template for creating standalone questions from chat history.

    This template serves two main purposes:
    1.  **Contextual Query Rewriting**: It instructs the LLM to reformulate a user's latest
        question into a standalone query that can be understood without reference to prior
        chat history. This is crucial for effective retrieval, as a vector database query
        typically requires a self-contained question. The LLM is explicitly told *not*
        to answer the question, but only to reformulate it or return it as is.
    2.  **Chatbot Identity & Capabilities**: It provides the LLM with its persona as the
        "NYP FYP CNC Chatbot" and details its various functionalities, including:
        user authentication, real-time chat, search, file upload and classification,
        audio input, persistent chat history, OCR, document/image/video processing,
        and sensitivity labeling. This ensures the LLM is aware of its capabilities
        and can accurately describe itself if asked.

    This template does not contain any direct placeholders, as the chat history and
    latest question are typically provided as separate inputs to the LLM (e.g., in a
    ``MessagesPlaceholder`` for chat history and a ``HumanMessage`` for the latest question).

    Returns the main system prompt template for the NYP FYP CNC Chatbot's
    general conversational capabilities.

    This comprehensive template defines the LLM's core persona and operational guidelines:
    -   **Identity and Role**: Establishes the LLM as an intelligent assistant for NYP
        staff and students, focused on data security and sensitivity labeling.
    -   **Key Features**: Outlines the chatbot's functionalities, including sensitivity
        label assistance, document/audio/image/video classification, OCR, real-time chat,
        and file analysis.
    -   **Data Security Levels & Sensitivity Categories**: Provides a clear list of
        classification labels that the chatbot understands and should refer to.
    -   **Mermaid Chart Support**: Crucially, it instructs the LLM on how to generate
        Mermaid syntax for various diagram types (Flowcharts, Sequence, Class, Gantt,
        Pie, Mind Map, ER Diagrams) when asked to create visual representations. It
        provides detailed rules for syntax generation, clarity, and explanation.
    -   **Answering Guidelines**: Directs the LLM to use only retrieved context (``{context}``)
        for answers, to respond respectfully and ethically, and to handle questions not
        found in the vector database by either using its best judgment (if NYP CNC related)
        or politely declining.
