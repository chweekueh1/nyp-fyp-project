Therefore, I will return the statement as is, and break.', 'Phishing emails are indeed an important aspect of data security. A phishing email is a type of fraudulent communication that typically appears to come from a legitimate source, such as a reputable company or organization. The goal of a phishing email is to trick the recipient into providing sensitive information, such as passwords, credit card numbers, or personal details, often by directing them to a fake website that looks legitimate. Being able to identify phishing emails is crucial for protecting personal and organizational data. Common signs of phishing emails include poor grammar, urgent requests for information, and suspicious links or attachments.']
